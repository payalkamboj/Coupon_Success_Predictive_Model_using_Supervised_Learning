## Project Overview:

It is of no surprise that these days business owners want to learn the customer behavior at its best in order to make the maximum profit. Blindly running business on assumptions can never fetch businessman with good profits. Knowing and understanding your customer is very important in order to grow any business. One should know which items to be put on sales or offers and which should not, for the better revenue. Starbucks Corporation is an American coffee company and coffee house chain. It uses the highest quality arabica coffee as the base for its espresso drinks. The starbucks capstone challenge of “Udacity Machine Learning Engineer nanodegree” provides the simulated data that mimics the starbucks rewards mobile application. In this project, I will work on this dataset in order to predict whether any customer would complete an offer successfully or not based on its demographic data and other details. This will help starbucks to better decide its offers based on the customers behaviour to make the maximum profit and still making the customer happy.

## Problem Statement/Metrics:

The problem I will solve here is to predict whether a customer will respond to an offer based on its demographic data and other details. This means given the offer and customer details, our model will predict if any particular offer would be successful or not. 
My strategy for solving this problem would be:
1. Cleaning the given data files given (portfolio, profile and transcript).
2. Combining the three data files to form a master dataset.
3. Building models to predict a customer’s response on given offer using Logistic regression and random forest classifiers.
Evaluation Metrics : The evaluation metrics would be accuracy and f1-score of naive, logistic regression and random forest classifiers.

## Softwares/Libraries used:

The project is supported by Python 3, libraries and packages:

    • Pandas
    • Seaborn
    • Matplotlib
    • Scikit learn 
    • Numpy
